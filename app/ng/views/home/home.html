    <h1 class="text-center">Who we are:</h1>
    <p class="text-center">Hello there! We are Christoph, Simon, Stefan and Robert, three students from the technical university munich (TUM) - Germany. <br>
    Our goal is to help people that want to cook with minimal effort for preparation and research before the actual cooking process.</p>

    <hr>
    <h1 class="text-center">How does it work:</h1>
    <p class="text-center">We have a large database filled up with handpicked recipes which were manually organised and sorted. If you are looking for a recipe we show you exactly what you are looking for and not hundred times the same or barely the same recipe like you know it from other websites.
    <br>Or you just insert your ingredients you want to use and we show you which recipes you can cook out of them. And if some ingredients are missing, we also show you where you can get them.
    <br>
